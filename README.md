# School-Register

- A dedicated school student management application tailored for efficiently tracking student progress and attendance.
- Administrators have comprehensive control, enabling them to:
  - Input or modify grades for individual students.
  - Register student attendance for specific dates and lessons.
  - Define and schedule lessons.
  - Enroll students in designated classes.
  - Manage user accounts, ensuring the right access and permissions.
- Students embark on their journey with the platform by first registering. To enhance security and ensure authenticity, they must validate their registration through an email confirmation.
- Post-confirmation, the administrator assigns the student to a specific class. Once assigned, students gain the ability to:
  - Access and review their academic grades.
  - View their class schedule.
  - Monitor their attendance record.
- From a technical perspective, the application is crafted using:
  - Python and Flask for the backend operations.
  - Jinja2 for templating.
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript formulating the frontend structure and interactivity.
